tensorflow-examples
A repository containing a lot of the code I wrote in Tensorflow. There are several models and concepts, each of which have their own folders. Please let me know if you find any bugs in these models, or if they can be improved somehow. Hope you enjoy them!

TODOs:

- update word2vec model to read in data correctly
- upload DCGAN and conditional GAN
